# Stereoscopic Vision

### Overview

The goal of this research was to intuitively teach Edwin to recognize and remember objects, thus creating a robust tool for dataset generation. This decreased the amount of time we would need to spend generating datasets of individual objects for any future machine learning.

In order to identify objects we were interested in "teaching" to Edwin, we developed a stereoscopic camera system that could locate an objects distance from Edwin. We then tagged any objects closer than a certain distance as "significant."
